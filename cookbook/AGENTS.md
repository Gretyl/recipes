# Working with recipe templates
Maintain a `notes/<template-name>.md` file and append notes to it as you work, tracking what you tried and anything you learned along the way.

When changes to a template are ready to commit, run "uvx showboat --help" and then use showboat to update the `demos/<template-name>.md` file to describe the behavior of the templated output.
