# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A collection of Cookiecutter templates, tooling for scaffolding Python projects, and a uv-managed Python project environment. The primary template is `cookbook/python-project/`, which generates a uv-managed Python project with ruff, mypy, pytest, and direnv support.

## Key Commands

Set up the development environment:

```bash
uv sync && direnv allow
```

Run `make test` before committing — it runs ruff check, ruff format, then pytest in sequence. See `Makefile` for all available targets and `USAGE.md` for full CLI syntax.

## Keeping USAGE.md in sync

`USAGE.md` (repo root) documents the `recipes` CLI's full syntax and output. It is generated by `uvx showboat` and must be regenerated whenever CLI syntax or semantics change — new subcommands, renamed options, altered output, etc. After making CLI changes, run `uvx showboat --help` and use showboat to update `USAGE.md`.

## Commit Conventions

Prefer atomic commits — each commit should contain a single logical change (one feature, one fix, one refactor). Separating concerns into distinct commits makes review easier and keeps `git bisect` useful. It's fine to commit tests and implementation separately when working in a TDD style.

All commits **must** use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for the subject line:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

### Types

- **feat** — new feature or functionality
- **fix** — bug fix
- **docs** — documentation-only changes
- **style** — formatting, whitespace, or cosmetic changes (no logic changes)
- **refactor** — code restructuring without changing external behavior
- **test** — adding or updating tests
- **chore** — maintenance tasks, dependency updates, CI config, etc.
- **build** — changes to the build system or tooling
- **ci** — continuous integration configuration changes
- **perf** — performance improvements

### Scopes

Use a scope that identifies the area of the codebase affected:

- **template** — `cookbook/python-project/` template files
- **cli** — `recipes_cli/` CLI package
- **recipes** — `recipes/` Python package
- **tests** — `tests/` test suite
- **docs** — `docs/` or top-level documentation files (README, AGENTS.md, etc.)
- **deps** — dependency or lockfile changes

The scope is required when the change clearly maps to one area. Omit it only for cross-cutting changes that span multiple scopes.

Avoid redundant type/scope pairs where the scope restates the type (e.g., `docs(docs):`, `test(tests):`). When the type already conveys the scope, omit the scope: `docs: update spec with new CLI usage`. Use a scope only when it adds information beyond the type.

### Examples

```
feat(cli): add export subcommand for templates
fix(template): correct pyproject.toml Python version
docs: update spec with new CLI usage
test: add coverage for generalize edge cases
chore(deps): bump ruff to 0.8.x
refactor(recipes): simplify hello_world module
```
